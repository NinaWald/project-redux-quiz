# Redux quiz group project

This week, the task is to build a quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple-choice quiz, so you'll need to define your own questions and a bunch of possible answers to present to your users.
✓ Your quiz should have at least 5 questions.
✓ When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
✓ While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many are left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'.
✓ When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen that tells them how many they got correct or incorrect.
✓ You should challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components that interact with the store - don't just go for one big component.
✓ Don't forget CSS! Your quiz should be well-styled.

You start setting up your Redux store, which will hold the state of your quiz game. You can create separate reducers for each aspect of the game, such as the current question, the user's score, and whether or not the user has answered each question correctly.

Then, you can start building your components. Make sure to keep them small and reusable, so that they can interact with the store and update the game state as needed.

You should also create a CSS stylesheet to style your quiz game. Make it visually appealing and user-friendly, with clear buttons and indicators for the user's progress through the quiz.
